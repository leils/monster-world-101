Movement: 
Gatherer prioritizes x-direction movement. 

X-Direction first: 
Gatherer first moves in the x-direction of the resource. If it cannot, it attempts to move in the y-direction of the resource. If impossible, will move in the opposite y-direction, and if that too is impossible, the opposite x-direction. 

Y-Direction first: (if gatherer is in the same x-coordinate as the resource, or if the previous movement around an obstacle require that the y-direction have priority)
Gatherer attempts y in direction of resource, then x in direction, then x in opposite, and finally y in opposite.
